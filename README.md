# date2day("29/02/2020") = 'saturday'


## INTRODUCTION

The name specifies what it does. Given a date it will convert it into a day

## HOW TO USE
 *Include this line in your script  
 * 		<script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/manikanta-kondeti/date2day/date2day.js"></script>
 *         Usage : 
 *        var day = date2day("23/6/2016");  // input must be a string : <day/month/year> 
 *        console.log(day); // Output must be a string ('thursday') or ('not a valid date').

## Motivation

I have got a small problem which involves dates and I wanted to extract day from each date. So I had written this library for similar purposes. Have you got more ideas? ping me and lets make it bigger. Code is fun :)
